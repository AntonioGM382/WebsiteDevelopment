# WebsiteDevelopment
In these files you can see all the projects that have helped me understand better the HTML elements that
make a web page look more professional. The first pages have elements that look not so good due to my attempts
to understand them. After some assignments I understood that the requirements that the professor asked were the 
key factor to understand and get better, so in the final dropbox assignment we could implement everything that we learned.
